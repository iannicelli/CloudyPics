# CloudyPics

Exam project for the Cloud Computing exam, focused on the development and deployment of a highly-available and scalable social media web application on the cloud, named CloudyPics. This web ap- plication aims to provide a robust platform where users can interact with each other and share photos of special moments seamlessly.

Key features of the web application include the ability for users to upload, like, and com- ment on pictures. Additionally, users have the option to follow other users to keep up with their content and ban users if necessary to maintain a safe and comfortable online environment.

The application also incorporates a dynamic stream feature, which displays images pub- lished by users whom the current user follows. This stream is designed to provide a real-time, personalized feed of updates, ensuring that users stay engaged with the latest content from their connections.

By leveraging cloud technologies, our application ensures high availability, scalability, and reliability, accommodating varying traffic loads and providing a seamless user experience.
